# Getting Started

In this section, you'll learn how to install docker compose onto your Unraid system, some basic commands, as well as how to make it a permanent install.

You will need to use the terminal for almost everything you do, which you can access from the webui using the `>_` icon or by `ssh`ing into your server.

I recommend using SSH, but you can use whatever method you want. There's official Unraid documentation on accessing the terminal [here](https://wiki.unraid.net/Terminal_Access).
